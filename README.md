No Public Epoc Block, Move Along.

Paid to be fit?!
================

ASIC Blaster Friendly, Hash based participation. Get paid based on your FitBit Usage! 

How does this work?
===================

By modifiying the BitCoin source code, we turn Proof of Work in to Proof of Participation. Finding blocks is only the beginning to securing the network. To get paid, you register a FitBit account to your wallet (nothing to a central server).





Keep your wallet.dat! If you lose it, you lose your money! A FitBit Linked account does not retain your money!
